	Note:
	(1) After this commit only Reame.txt file was modified to include this commit information.
	(2) 2 links are provided for source access. It was observed gatech github asks for login to give access to the repository. To get the source without login use Link 2

2) File Details
	The code has below source files -
		RLtester.py
		RLmdptoolbox.py
		RLmdp.py
		
	results directory consists of the plots and the result.txt file when the code is executed -
		result\
	
3) Required Libraries to execute the code
	env.yml consists of packages that are required to execute the code.
    On system terminal where Anaconda is installed (supporting python 3.6) execute - 
		$conda env create --file ml.yml
    
	The main libraries required to execute the code on python3.6 are scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
	
    Then enter the env to execute the code as in Code execution
		$conda activate ml
    
    To exit the env 
		$conda deactivate	


4) Working environment where this code was used (System Setup)

    On a Windows 10 machine Pycharm editor with Anaconda python 3.6 as project interpreter was used to implement the code. 
	

5) Code execution

    On a python3.6 console execute command with all required libraries installed, activate conda environment as explained above.
    Then execute `RLtester.py`

	For Linux environment
		$ python RLtester.py
	
    Note: Code execution takes ~15minutes to produce the results. 
    
6) Output

    The code generates plots and a Results.txt file with data. They are stored into `result` directory.
